        <p>The perfect medium rare steak has a juicy red center while avoiding chewiness and toughness. 
            The ideal recipe involves a very hot pan, with even heating of both sides of the steak to 
            produce a nice flavorful crust. This recipe also calls for creation of a butter sauce to
            enhance the flavor of the meat.</p>
