        <p>First, the filling must be made by boiling the chicken with the carrots, peas and celery.
            The onions are then cooked in butter until translucent, then the flour and seasoning is added.
            Add chicken broth and milk, and simmer until filling is thick. Next, the pie will be filled and baked.
            Place the chicken-vegetable mixture in an unbaked pie crust, and pour the chicken broth mixture over it.
            Cover the top crust, seal edges, and cut slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Bake until pastry
            is golden brown and filling is bubbly.</p>
